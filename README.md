自制pcb （Self made PCB）

这是一个开源游戏机的pcb，

我是为了一些想要做，arduboy游戏机但是难于焊接的人准备的

这个pcb只是因为个人的需要（懒得焊接)

需要准备的：1.arduino pro micro -一个
          2.1.3寸oled显示屏注意是七个管脚的（也可以是六个cs是选接的）
          3.按钮6*6*4.x
          4.滑动开关(侧)四脚
          5.充放一体的充电板
          6.锂电池厚度小于等于5mm
          7.M2螺柱长5mm
          8.强度螺丝M2*3
  两个pcb通过螺柱连接完整后只有一张名片大小，厚度是5mm
           
           
这个pcb板标的是v2.1，因为第一个版本遇到了很多问题所以我就不寄存了

如果你觉的有趣那么可以自己制作pcb板这个文件是可以直接发到厂家制作的，当然你也可以自己修改制作

这个只是个人的娱乐罢了，寄存在github，分享一下😊😊

新加的底板上面是供电

English

This is the PCB of an open source game console. Of course, you can see that this is arduboy

I'm for someone who wants to make an arduboy but is hard to weld.

The welding quantity of this project is small and the welding is easy

This PCB is just for personal needs (lazy to weld)

What to prepare: 
1.Arduino Pro micro - one

2.the 1.3-inch OLED display has seven pins (or six CS are optional)

3.Button 6*6*4.x

4. Four feet of sliding switch (side)

5. Charging board integrated with charging and discharging

6. Thickness of lithium battery is less than or equal to 5mm

7. M2 stud length 5mm

8. Strength screw M2*3
After the two PCBs are completely connected by studs, they are only the size of a business card, with a thickness of 5mm

This PCB board is marked with v2.1. Because the first version encountered many problems, I will not register it

If you think it's interesting, you can make your own PCB board. This file can be sent directly to the manufacturer for making. Of course, you can also modify and make your own

It's just for personal entertainment. Leave it in GitHub and share it.😊😊
